# Smart_Undervoltage_and_Overvoltage_protection
INTRODUCTION:

The fluctuation in voltage is the major issue facing industry and home today, it is the cause which is responsible for damaging valuable equipment. If any unexpected fluctuation in the power supply may cause many problems in the industries, homes, offices. Voltage fluctuations in the electric power supply have a very poor effect on connected load.These fluctuations of over voltage and under voltage protection system are produced by many reasons which are like voltage surges, limiting, overload and etc. Protection system from the voltage fluctuation is needed for both equipment and user. Due to irregularity in voltages electrical appliances are not allowed to use without any protective device installed. 
Technically speaking, an over/under voltage condition is reached when the voltage exceeds/lags the nominal voltage by10% for more than 1 minute. Short duration voltage events can also occur such as transients (both impulsive and oscillatory). Short duration intermittent supply failures can last anywhere from 0.5 cycles up to 1 minute and can be caused by a number of occurrences such as supply system faults, equipment failures, or malfunctions in control equipment. Under-voltage might result into brownout, distortion or permanent damage while overvoltage in the form of spikes and surges could cause distortion, burn-out, meltdown, fire and permanent damages. In this paper, the conditions of voltage are calculated and the normal condition of this protection system which is 230 volts as the undervoltage condition is recognized in between 200 to 230 volts and the overvoltage condition is recognized in between 230 to 250 volts. To protect the load, a relay is implemented with load, under these conditions the relay functions accordingly like it will switch OFF if the voltage is observed under and over and it will switch ON if the condition is observed normal. Here, as a voltage sensor, LV25P is used, which can sense voltage of higher ranges also, with this specification this project can also be used for industrial purposes.  

OBJECTIVE 
 
The objective  of  this  system is to  provide  protection  to  the equipment’s and  avoid their   failure   due   to   abnormal   conditions.   This   system provides protection for industrial, commercial and residential equipment’s. 
The process  of  this  system  is  whenever  there  an  overvoltage  or  under  voltage  the relay sense the input from operational amplifier and gets trip and the load is off. Thus, it protects the electrical appliance. 

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
•	In this project under voltage, normal and over voltage conditions recognized accurately. 
•	The value of the voltage displayed on LCD. 
•	The relay protects the load accurately by functioning OFF at under and over voltage conditions and ON at normal conditions. 
•	The peak value from the voltage source is accurately given to the Arduino to recognise the conditions. 
•	In this system detection of voltage conditions effectively not frequency and phase.
